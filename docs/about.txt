# HashWizard — Hash brute-forcer
# Version: 0.1
# Project start: 2025-09-09
# Idea conceived: February 2025
#
# About:
# HashWizard is a straightforward hash brute-forcer. It tries different attack
# methods (dictionary, mask, brute-force, combinations) to recover the original
# input from a hash digest. Think of it as a password-cracking engine: you give
# it a hash, it keeps guessing until it finds a match.
#
# Platforms:
# Started on Windows, but designed to be cross-platform.
#
# Implementation:
# Written in Batch, Python, and C. Early builds were experimental, but compilation
# support is now on the roadmap.
#
# Capabilities:
# - Dictionary-based attacks
# - Mask/charset brute-forcing
# - Rule-based modifications
# - Basic rainbow-table lookups
#
# Project nature:
# HashWizard is a hobbyist project made for tech enthusiasts, learners and
# researchers. It is not a commercial product — donations may support further
# development, but the software itself is free to use and share.
#
# Note:
# This is not a generic "utility" or disguised tool — it is a hash brute-forcer,
# built to experiment with password recovery techniques in a clear, direct way.
# Terms of use and licensing are covered in the LICENSE file.
